# Build React Flexbox components from Webflow official examples


## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with `create-react-app` to make it faster and easier to get up and running. We want to prioritise coding over installing and configuring!

To get a local copy running on your computer:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/daneasterman/class-hooks-tweetbox.git`
2. Install all the project dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Start the project: `yarn start`

Very much open to any feedback also please let me know if you have any problems getting set up, you can contact me on twitter: `@daneasterman`

N.B: the above assumes you have node and yarn already installed.
